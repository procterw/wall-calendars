# Wall calendar builder

This is more of a utility for a larger project I'm working on. I wanted an easy way to generate wall calendars that have the following properties:

 - Creates images that are printable on 11x17 (or later, other options) paper with 300dpi
 - Makes it easy to swap in different artist, font, image proportions etc. to quickly prototype, since I'll be making many batches of these with various artists
 - (TODO later) Ability to add custom dates like birthdays of friends, or remove irrelevant holidays

## What's the larger project?

Well, I've recently found wall calendars to be a much more useful way to track appointments, events, and projects than using the digital version. However, there were a few things about normal wall calendars I didn't like, such as limited vertical space, lots of ugly options, and bad writing surface. My plan is to build a series of mounts which hold printed 11x17 sheets that can be customized person to person, and then easily updated and reprinted for the next year.

## How it's going so far
